# vim-lorem
A very simple snippet plugin.

Each snippet (or "lorem") is stored in it's own file. Lorems are searched for on the runtimepath recursively under directories named `lorems`.

Invoke with the `Lorem` command.

Invocation Examples:
```
Lorem "lorem.fill"
Lorem "lorem.js"
Lorem "lorem.jsx"
Lorem "lorem.pl"
Lorem "lorem.txt"
Lorem "lorem.vader"
Lorem "mysnippet.txt"
```
