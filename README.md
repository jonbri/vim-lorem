# vim-lorum
A very simple snippet plugin.

Each snippet (or "lorum") is stored in it's own file. Lorums are searched for on the runtimepath recursively under directories named `lorums`.

Invoke with the `Lorum` command.

Invocation Examples:
```
Lorum "lorum.fill"
Lorum "lorum.js"
Lorum "lorum.pl"
Lorum "lorum.txt"
Lorum "lorum.vader"
Lorum "mysnippet.txt"
```
